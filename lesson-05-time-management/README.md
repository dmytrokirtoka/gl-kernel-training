## Lesson 05 - Time Management

* Implement kernel module with API in sysfs or procfs, which returns time (in seconds) passed since previous read of it.
* Investigate the difference of absolute time API in userspace library and kernel space.
* Try to implement kernel module with API in sysfs or procfs, which returns absolute time of previous reading.
* Implement kernel module with API in sysfs or procfs, which return Fibonacci sequence. Each element of sequence should be generated once in a second.
